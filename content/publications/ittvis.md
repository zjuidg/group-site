## Abstract
The rapid development of information technology paved the way for the recording of fine-grained data, such as stroke
techniques and stroke placements, during a table tennis match. This data recording creates opportunities to analyze and evaluate
matches from new perspectives. Nevertheless, the increasingly complex data poses a significant challenge to make sense of and gain
insights into. Analysts usually employ tedious and cumbersome methods which are limited to watching videos and reading statistical
tables. However, existing sports visualization methods cannot be applied to visualizing table tennis competitions due to different
competition rules and particular data attributes. In this work, we collaborate with data analysts to understand and characterize the
sophisticated domain problem of analysis of table tennis data. We propose iTTVis, a novel interactive table tennis visualization system,
which to our knowledge, is the first visual analysis system for analyzing and exploring table tennis data. iTTVis provides a holistic
visualization of an entire match from three main perspectives, namely, time-oriented, statistical, and tactical analyses. The proposed
system with several well-coordinated views not only supports correlation identification through statistics and pattern detection of tactics
with a score timeline but also allows cross analysis to gain insights. Data analysts have obtained several new insights by using iTTVis.
The effectiveness and usability of the proposed system are demonstrated with four case studies.
